Welcome to my personal homepage! I am Yuye Wu, an undergraduate student in the Department of Astronomy, School of Physical Science and Technology, Xiamen University (class of 2024). My research interest lies on gravational wave phenomena from compact object mergers in active galactic nuclei (AGN). I welcome your insights and discussions.
